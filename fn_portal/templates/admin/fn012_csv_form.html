        <h2>FN012 Protocol Values Upload</h2>

        <p>This form can be used by GLIS administrators to upload new
            values for FN012 Protocols.  The uploaded csv file should be
            exactly the same as the downloaded csv file, with the addition
            of columns 'lake' and 'protocol' that the FN012 values will be
            associated with.  The values in those two columns should
            contain the abbreviations for those entities (e.g. - 'HU'
            and 'BSM').</p>
