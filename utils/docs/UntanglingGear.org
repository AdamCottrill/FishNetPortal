* Gear

- CPUE is the fundamental measure of virtually all fisheries
  assessment programs
- effort (in cpue) is directly dependent on the gear that was used to
  obtain the catch.
- impossible to compare cpue numbers without knowledge of gear.


* Existing Data Sources
- Gear codes in UGMLU databases are messy
  - some gear descriptions in FN013 and FN014 tables in Fishnet
    archive.  Good for many projects in 1990s, earlier projects sketchy,
    latter project non-existent
  - some gear fields in master databases (GR, GRTP, EFF, EFFDST) that
    allow us to reconstruct some gears
- Darrel's Gear Spreadsheet
- Lookup tables on server
- available documentation on Project Tracker

* Gear and our data model

- Gear defines FN122 table:
  + one record per sam for traps and hoops
  + one record for each panel of gill nets
  + can't have records for meshes not in gear
  + ProcVal can check for these if gear is well defined and consistent
    across projects

* Gear:
+ A master table of gears.  This will evaully replace the FN013
  table.
+ Each gear will only be defined once and will be associated
  to each SAM by Gear Code (or foreign key).

* Subgear:
+ A master table of gear panel attributes - each sub-gear will only
  be defined once and asscoaited with the appropriate gear through a
  many-to-many relationship.
  + For example, the 51mm offshore panel is used in multiple gears,
    and each gear has multple panels/subgears.
+ analogous to data in Darrel's spreadsheet

* Gear Family:

+ A table to constrain relationships between gears and sub-gears
+ Gears are comprised of subgears, but only subgears in the same family
  should be allowed.
+ For example:

  + GL10, GL21, GL22 and GL32 are all derived from offshore
    monofilament (OSIA-mono) panels

  + GL01 is offshore multifilament (OSIA-multi)

  + GL50 is a FWIN family

  + GL38, GL51, GL64 are all part of the FLIN/SLIN family

* Gear Family (cont'd):
+ More Families:
  + Nordic nets
  + Bottle traps
  + GEE traps
  + Windermere traps
  + Smallfish-tall
  + Smallfish-short
  + North American Standard
  + Trap nets
  + Hoop nets
  + Unknown*


* Gear2SubGear
+ association table to facilitate many-to-many between gear and
    subgear
+ contains additional information:
  + panel sequence
  + panel count

* How we are going to get there?

- use fn\under{}portal
- database tables for old fishnet tables have been created and populated
  - tables from the fish net archive will be used where possible
  - more recent data will be populated from gear codes where gear
    details are known (e.g. - offshore gears)
  - project leads, field staff may be asked to provide some input

- Gear, subgear and gear family tables have been created and populated
  from available data.

- summary of gears used in a project have been be added to project details
  in fn\under{}portal

* How we are going to get there?
- views have been created in fn\under{}portal to:
  + list gears
  + gear details
    + about the gear
    + associated sub-gears
    + projects where gear was used
    + active/depreciated
    + confirmed
  + edit gear description
- list of gears to be updated by <USER>

* What have we learned?
- all projects need specific project protocols (many are missing from
  project tracker)
- project protocols need to explicit describe gear used in project
  + generic "same as other project" shortcuts are not adequate
- science 101 - sufficient detail to reproduce/re-run project

* Gill Net Examples

* Trap Net Examples

#+LATEX: \end{figure}


* Other Gears:
+ any suggestions?
  + fyke nets
  + hoop nets
  + bottle traps
  + Windermere traps
  + electrofishing
  + others...

* Consolidating Gear codes
- process of updating project masters to match gear master
- documenting undocumented GL and TP codes
  - inspecting FN122, FN123 and FN125 tables.  Inferring gear from
    similar projects in same year
- FishNet Archive/FishLib
  - possible our archive are incomplete,  especially for projects run
    by other offices (Espanola/Severn Sound)

* Trap Nets
- 3 proposed codes:
  + TP06 - Standard 6' trap net
  + TP08 - Standard 8' trap net
  + TP  - Undocumented trap net (only in rare cases)
+ update masters to these codes where information exists to identify
  trap net size

* Gill Nets
- eliminate gear code synonyms
- update gear codes where inconsistencies are evident


* Next Steps/Homework
- confirm assigned gears:
  - provide description for assigned gear
  - verify sub gear attributes:
    - populate where possible
    - check existing values
- FLIN gear used with one or multiple efforts. Can these be the same gear
  code?
  + 1 can mean half of the net or all of the net
- export gear code master tables
- update proc-val to query master tables
